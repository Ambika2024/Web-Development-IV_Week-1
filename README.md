# Web-Development-IV_Week-1
My team and I will be developing a collaborative "The Enchanted Isle" interactive story using Markdown files. The project will be divided into stages, with each team member contributing different story paths and narrative sections. We'll utilize Git and GitHub for version control, where we'll create individual branches for our contributions, review and provide feedback on each other's changes through pull requests, and merge them into the main branch once approved. This process will ensure a cohesive and engaging interactive story.
