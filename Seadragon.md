# Return to the Sea Dragon

You decide to return to the "Sea Dragon," feeling that it might be wise to consult with your team before exploring further. As you board the ship, your first mate greets you with a concerned look. "Captain, the island feels... wrong," they say. "The crew is uneasy."

You gather your team in the ship’s cabin to discuss the next steps. Your map shows a hidden cave on the northern side of the island, and your navigator suggests it may hold clues to the island’s secrets. Meanwhile, your archaeologist insists that the temple ruins are key to unraveling the island’s mystery.
