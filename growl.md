# Run from the Growling Noise

Panic surges through you as the growl echoes in the dense jungle. Without thinking, you turn and sprint down the overgrown path, heart racing. The sound of your footsteps blends with the rustling leaves and branches snapping underfoot.

As you run, you hear the growl grow louder behind you, followed by a rush of movement. You dart left and right to avoid obstacles, but the jungle seems to conspire against you, vines and branches reaching out as if to slow you down.

Just when you think you canâ€™t run any longer, you stumble into a small clearing. Ahead, you see a large tree with a sturdy trunk that might provide shelter. You could also take your chances and try to climb a nearby rock formation.
