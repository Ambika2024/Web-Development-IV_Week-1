The Mysterious Island

You've always been fascinated by the sea and its secrets. As a skilled sailor and explorer, you've spent years studying the ancient maps and legends of a mysterious island said to be hidden in the heart of the ocean. They call it Isla del Cielo, the Island of the Sky.

After months of preparation, you've finally assembled a team of experts and set sail on your trusty vessel, the "Sea Dragon." The journey has been long and arduous, but finally, you've caught sight of the island's towering peaks rising from the mist.

As you approach the island's shores, you notice that the air is thick with an otherworldly energy. The trees seem to lean in, as if listening to your every thought. You can feel the weight of history and mystery emanating from the island's ancient ruins.

You've anchored the "Sea Dragon" in a secluded cove, and now you're standing on the island's sandy beach, gazing up at the ruins of a long-abandoned temple. The air is heavy with the scent of exotic spices and the sound of distant drums echoes through the jungle.
What do you do next?
