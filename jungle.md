# Dense Jungle

You venture into the dense jungle, the air thick with humidity and the sound of chirping insects. The vegetation is lush and vibrant, with towering trees whose leaves block out most of the sunlight. The path ahead is barely visible, overgrown with thick vines and thorny bushes. As you move deeper, you notice strange markings on the trees — arrows pointing in different directions.

Suddenly, the jungle goes quiet. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up as you realize you’re not alone. You hear a rustling in the bushes to your right and a loud growl behind you.
