# Investigate the Source of the Rustling

Curiosity gets the better of you, and you decide to investigate the source of the rustling. You cautiously approach the bushes, careful not to make any sudden movements. As you part the thick leaves, you find a small, trembling creatureâ€”a colorful bird with vibrant feathers, its wings tucked tightly against its body.

The bird looks at you with wide, frightened eyes. It appears to be injured, unable to fly. As you kneel down to get a closer look, you hear a low growl once more, this time closer and more menacing.
