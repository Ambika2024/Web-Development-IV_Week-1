# Set Sail to Circle the Island

You decide it’s best to set sail and circle the island, looking for other clues. You gather your crew, and soon the "Sea Dragon" is cutting through the waves, the sound of the ocean invigorating everyone on board.

As you navigate around the island, you notice unusual rock formations and strange patterns in the water that suggest underwater currents might be hiding something significant. After a while, you spot a secluded cove that isn’t marked on your map.

The crew seems excited, and you feel a pull to explore this uncharted area. You drop anchor and prepare to investigate.
