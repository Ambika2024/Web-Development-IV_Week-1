# Descend the Staircase into the Darkness

Gripping the cold stone rail, you carefully make your way down the spiral staircase. The air grows colder as you descend, and the hum you heard before grows louder, resonating deep in your bones. At the bottom of the staircase, you find yourself in a large chamber filled with ancient statues. In the center of the room stands a stone altar, glowing with an otherworldly light.
