# Ancient Temple

You decide to approach the ruins of the ancient temple. The stone structure towers over you, its once pristine walls now covered in vines and moss. Strange carvings cover the templeâ€™s facade, depicting celestial symbols and scenes of an ancient civilization long forgotten. The entrance is partially blocked by rubble, but you manage to squeeze through the gap.

Inside, the air is cool and damp. Dim light filters through cracks in the stone ceiling, casting eerie shadows on the floor. As you venture deeper, you hear a faint hum, almost like chanting, echoing from the depths of the temple.

Suddenly, the ground beneath your feet trembles, and a stone door slides shut behind you. You're trapped, but you notice a staircase leading downward into the dark. You also see a faint glow coming from a side passageway to your left.
